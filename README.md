# Data-analysis-on-Music-store-using-Sql

Created a Data base called Music Store 
Created tables in that database using  different constraints like primary key, foreign key to develop connections between the tables. 
Then imported the data in to the tables from csv files and performed Sql queries to get insights from data.
